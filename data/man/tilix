.SH SYNOPSIS

.RI [ options ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBtilix\fP is an advanced GTK3 tiling terminal emulator designed to adhere to Gnome Human Interface Guidelines.
.SH OPTIONS
The \fBtilix\fP application accepts the following command line parameters:
.TP
.B \-h \-\-help 
Show help options.
.TP
.B \-v \-\-version

.TP
.B \-w \-\-working-directory=DIRECTORY
Set the working directory of the terminal.
.TP
.B \-p \-\-profile=PROFILE_NAME

Set the title of the new terminal.
.TP
.B \-s \-\-session=SESSION_NAME
Open the specified session file which has been previously saved. Session files are saved from within Tilix, they store the complete layout of the session enabling the user to re-load it when required. Note that only the layout and layout options are saved, this will not restore the terminal to where it was left off, rather new terminals are created.  
.TP
.B \-a \-\-action=ACTION_NAME
Perform an action in the current Tilix instance, the following actions are supported:
.IP
.B session-add-right
Adds a new terminal to the right of the current terminal.
.IP
.B session-add-down
Adds a new terminal down from the current terminal.
.IP
.B app-new-session

.IP
.B app-new-window

.TP
.B \-e \-\-command=COMMAND
Execute all text after this parameter as a command, thus this parameter must be the last parameter.

.B \-\-new\-process
Start an additional Tilix instance as a new process. By default and as per GTK+ 3 guidelines, Tilix maintains a single process that all windows belong to. This option forces Tilix to start as a separate process. This is not recommended and is intended for debugging purposes only, using this option will prevent different Tilix windows from communicating with each other.
